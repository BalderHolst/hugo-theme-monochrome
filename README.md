# Why?
This is a hugo theme based on the [monochrome theme](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-monochrome) that i use on [my website](balderholst.com) . This version is a bit darker, and supports [Hugoify](https://github.com/BalderHolst/Hugoify) a program i made for exporting an [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md) to hugo. 

### What is different?
* I swapped the sun and moon icon, as i thought that it was more fitting this way
* Supports many things from Obsidian like callouts
* Project page type for showing off projects
* Darker dark theme

# Credits
This is a fork of [kaiiiz/hugo-theme-monochrome](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-monochrome) by [You-Kai Zheng](https://github.com/kaiiiz).

It is a wonderful theme, and works great out of the box.

A Demo of the original Monochrome theme can be found [here](https://kaiiiz.github.io/hugo-theme-monochrome/).
